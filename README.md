# KingMLR
This is a Python data project using scikit-learn's Multiple Linear Regression models and feature power tranformations to predict home values in King County, WA.

Future ideas/plans include: using cross-validation to split the data instead of a traditional 80/20 split.

## Files 
- King County Homes.csv - (16187 X 20) dataset with house prices and predictors 
- KingMLR.py - A Multiple Linear Regression model with error metrics and visualizations
